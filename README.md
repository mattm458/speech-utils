# Speech utilities

This repository contains a variety of speech-related functionality I use often in my research. It's a dumping ground for stuff I do in different repos so I don't have to reimplement the same thing over and over. Additionally, a lot of my work involves combining different models together, so the repo allows me to centralize important logic.
